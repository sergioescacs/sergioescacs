Since I was 12 years old i've been coding in some diferent languages: Java, Javascript, C++ and Python. Now days, I'm still learning new things.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structure and Algorithms with Python. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new Projects with big and interesting goals on it.
