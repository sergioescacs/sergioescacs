## Welcome to my GitHub page

Since I was 12 years old i've been coding in some diferent languages: **Java**, **Javascript**, **C++** and **Python**. Now days, I'm still learning new things.

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my new project [CHESS ELO CALCULATOR](https://github.com/sergioescacs/chess-elo), which u can easily find in the "pinned" section.
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning *Data Structure* and *Algorithms* with **Python**. 
  - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **new Projects** with big and interesting goals on it. 
  - ðŸ“« If u have any doubt or if u just want to talk about coding, my email: *sergioescacs@gmail.com* or contact with me through my discord account: *sergioescacs#8611*.
