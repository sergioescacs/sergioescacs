## Welcome to my GitHub page. 

Since I was 12 years old i've been coding in some diferent languages: Java, Javascript, C++ and Python. Now days, I'm still learning new things. 

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my new project CHESS ELO CALCULATOR, which u can easily find in the "pinned" section. 
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structure and Algorithms with Python. 
  - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new Projects with big and interesting goals on it. 
  - ðŸ“« If u have any doubt or if u just want to talk with me about coding, my mail: sergioescacs@gmail.com . 

Read and enjoy :)
